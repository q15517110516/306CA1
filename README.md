# CA1: Vowel Sound
Repeat the analysis of a vowel sound in SPP 12.4, "Analysis of Vowel Sound", for your vowel sound.  Record your own voice making a vowel sound (any vowel).  Submit a jupyter notebook analyzing your own voice.  You may use the code in SPP, but you must make any adaptations for your own voice.  Also, each code cell should be preceded by a markdown cell explaining what the code does and why it is there.   The markdown cell should be a paragraph or so.  Use your own words, not those in SPP.

Make sure your notebook runs without errors.  Also, embed your plots and Audio widgets within the notebook.
